# The DeSSUF Project

## Presentation

DeSSUF means "A Methodology for the Design of a Safe, Secure and User-Friendly Reactive Programming Language for the Internet of Things". 

In the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of devices are connected. Very often, these  devices are programmed with the C programming language, 
mostly because of the limited hardware resources of such objects. However, C is error-prone, and software bugs make devices both unreliable and 
vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Several cases of massive cyber-attacks using IoT devices are documented. 
Moreover, the IoT is more and more deployed in areas such as energy, transportation and health: it is of paramount importance such systems 
are reliable, safe and secure. The goal of the DeSSUF project is the design, implementation, and the evaluation of the safety, security 
and ease-of-use of a new programming language for the IoT. 

This is a joint project between the [University of Orleans](https://www.univ-orleans.fr), [LIFO](https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo), France 
and the [University of Maribor](https://www.um.si/en), [LPM](https://lpm.feri.um.si/en/), Slovenia both members of the 
[Athena European University](http://www.athenaeuropeanuniversity.eu).
